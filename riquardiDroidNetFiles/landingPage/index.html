<p>The stage of last-mile delivery to the hands of the customer of any item is a challenging task due to the randomness and inconsistency events (objects/hurdles/people/animals etc) often in a unique order for every case present. Making it so difficult to automate or even assist by technology to a concrete extent that we still use humans to execute the task. The presence of humans in this stage implies things like Confusion in figuring out the destination - implying extra time to delivery, Slow speed of the executive, and also the risk of human to human contact having far from ideal outcomes possible, as we saw in CoVid-19 transmission, to the cases of deliveryAgent-customer argument/scuffles.</p>
<p>Riquardi intends to use <i>Drones</i> called 'Droid' to automate and streamline the delivery process to an extent that shortens delivery time by a considerable margin, reduces customer to employee contact to ZERO, and increased the visibility of the brand while in transit to multiple times more than a human with a T-Shirt</p>

								<p>I wish to make it a startup, Launched to serve people some legal, edible products via Droids flying from the dispatch location straight to the location of the customer, This implies a consent between the source and destination of the Droid to have a clear intent of a flight. Riquardi agrees to not fly over No-Fly zones, provided the constraints are explicitly listed ensuring NO to Just-Harmless ambiguity.</p>
								<p>We take location data from the user just like humans do, We take the path above ground level, passing around/over-from-a-considerable-height some private property just like humans do, and Don't stand at your door while you arrange money...thereby being present inside your property, looking inside. Payments are always online.</p>

								<p>I, Tushar Pandey, am the creator of this web content and also the individual behind Riquardi at present. I happen to be an Engineering Graduate from New Delhi, India. With a history of loving wildlife via Discovery before I could tie shoelaces to making my first website in class 9th to further Having some experience in Machine learning, Mobile application(Android primary) Development, Web development, Arduino/8085 Microprocessor-based development, and some other skills that I picked on (and still keep doing so), my attributes somehow steer me to carve a workflow to mold my ideas into some extent of their intended morphology.
I find it necessary to list the fact here that people in this world wishing to make and bring change in any form to its operation shall strive to give every possible permutation of themselves to the world. <br> Who knows, who needs whom?  </p>
