The API python page fetches the .csv.zip file and stores in the folder (DRIVE);
Unzip it via python code and read the csv, load the stock name and price in a dictionary, sort it and create an API endpoint for sending the list to the client. 
The client has an empty set of image tags filled with sample data and displays that incase the list is unavailable. Now the list received will be used to assign a stock and every part to it during runtime by HTML set attribute function. Now when that is done, any extra tags left unassigned will be done a CSS reset of "display:none;" and the total count of stocks in market for that day will be displayed to the user.
