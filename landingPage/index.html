				<p>The state of automobile sector in India is not bad at the moment. All the big brands coming in, some huge aquisitions, great Exits and interesting entries!! 
				But have you even put some energy and time into thinking what makes these cars running on the roads, who allows them to be there for eternity... untill some legal filter decides that from then onwards, so and so vehicle be taken off the road?</p>
				<p>PunctureBuddy intends to serve that strata of soceity.. our <i>Mechanics</i> called 'Pilots', (for they will take us flying high to laurels) to Organise and streamline the mechanic service delivery process to an extent that shortens service time by a considerable margin, reduces customer hassle to ZERO, and increases the
					visibility of the brand while in transit to multiple times more than a shed with a board that though barely legible... says "Mechanic"</p>

			<!-- About -->
			<article id="about">
				<h2 class="major">Team</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>We in the Founding Team, are the creators of this web content and also the individual behind PunctureBuddy at present. While one happens to be an CS Engineering Graduate from New Delhi, India. With a history of loving wildlife via Discovery before I could tie
					shoelaces to making my first website in class 9th to further Having some experience in Machine learning, Mobile application(Android primary) Development, Web development, Arduino/8085 Microprocessor-based development, and some other skills
					that I picked on (and still keep doing so), my attributes somehow steer me to carve a work-flow to mold my ideas into some extent of their intended morphology. The other guy being through the highs and lows of his life... a Biotechnology Post Grad means business down with his skills arming him to the teeth to take on any person in the world, and make sure their problems are solved. From the car he drives, to the fragrance he wears, you will never get a chance to decipher the inner story but yes, as they say.. the show must go on! and with a team of this stature, It sure will do!!
					We find it necessary to list the fact here that people in this world wishing to make and bring change in any form to its operation shall strive to give every possible permutation of themselves to the world. <br> Who knows, who needs whom?
